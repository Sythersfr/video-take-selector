Why are you lying to me?
I’m not lying to you.
But you’re not telling me everything.
Since when do I have to?
You don’t— but I’d like you to tell me the truth.
Have I ever lied to you?
You don’t have to lie to not tell the truth.
…I’m just not ready to tell you.
Do you not trust me?
Not enough for this.
Then what has to change?
I just want to know you won’t hurt me.
I’ve never hurt you before.
Because I’ve never made you angry.
You think I’ll hurt you if you make me mad?
I don’t know but I don’t want to find out.
…okay— do something terrible to me.
..what?
Give me something disgusting so I get mad and you can see that I won’t hurt you.
I’m sorry— I’m not gonna do that.
Wait a minute— why aren’t you drinking that?
…it’s not very good.
What’s wrong with it?
He tried to make a paper plane— but he only used Aperol, Amaro, and bourbon— it’s not worth drinking.
Does he know he made it wrong?
Why isn’t she drinking it?
I think you made a bad cocktail.
That’s impossible, it’s a paper plane.
Then maybe she doesn’t drink.
I mean she’s responsible but I’ve made her cocktails before and she’s loved them.
Then why don’t you ask her?
…do you not want this?
No I do— it’s just hard to drink.
What’s wrong with it?
What do I tell him?
The truth?
Why isn’t she saying anything?
She just doesn’t want to make you mad.
But I want her to like this— I made this for her.
Then this is what you’re gonna say to her.
But what if he gets mad at me?
Just be careful and make sure you can leave— but if someone gets mad at you for telling them the truth, they’re probably not worth your time.
Hey.
Tell me what you’d tell me if you knew I wouldn’t get mad.
…This needs lemon juice.
Gauge his reaction.
Now actually don’t get mad.
Thank you for telling me.
